# ATI Services

This repository contains the following standalone services:

## Barra

### Barra Upload

Extracts holdings data from the Charles River IMS (CRIMS), formats as XML and uploads to Barra. This process runs on a daily basis. The process is currently configured to run as as a [WebJob](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/web-sites-create-web-jobs/).

The upload specification is [contained here](http://#)

### Barra Export

Extracts Risk data from Barra and loads it into the ATMI1 Investments database. The process will trigger one or more Export Sets within Barra (to be extracted sequentially), polling on a configurable frequency for completion status. Once the Export completes, the CSV results are parsed and loaded.

Export Sets are loaded in the following order:

UCITS Positions
UCITS Positions FI
UCITS HVaR





## Factset

### FactsetLoader

Parses XLS(X) files from Factset and loads into the ATMI1 Investments Data Warehouse. This process is triggered by the creation of a new Azure Blob storage item. It will respond by processing the input file(s) and loading as appropriate. 

The input blob is accessed as:

```javascript
public static void Extract([BlobTrigger("input/folder1/folder2/{name}")] TextReader input){
	...
    var input = input.ReadToEnd();


}
```
